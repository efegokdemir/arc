package backup

// Cluster awareness for backup and restore (#1083).
//
// On a cluster node the Raft file manifest, not the storage listing, says
// which files are data. Compaction commits in two Raft phases on two watcher
// ticks (internal/compaction/watcher.go): the output is registered when it
// has been written, and the inputs are manifest-deleted on a later tick, once
// the subprocess reports them gone from its storage. Peers pull the output in
// between, but nothing waits for them. A listing taken in that window holds
// the output and the inputs it replaced, and in Pattern 1 compaction runs on
// the compactor, so the primary never holds the _compaction_state manifests
// the #930 restore logic needs. A restore that put both back would serve
// every row twice, on every node, forever. So a cluster backup copies what
// the manifest lists and nothing else, reads the manifest once more at the
// end of the run and drops what the cluster has since said is no longer data,
// says what it left out in each direction, and carries a sidecar from which a
// cluster restore registers each file it writes. The residual window is a
// phase 2 that has not landed by the end of the run: the inputs are still
// registered, and the backup holds them next to the output exactly as the
// cluster does at that moment.
//
// Everything here is behind two optional hooks the Manager holds as
// interfaces: ClusterManifest (the Raft manifest, read and write) and
// TierRecorder (this node's tier metadata). Both are nil on a standalone node
// without tiering, and every path that touches them checks for nil first, so
// OSS behaviour is unchanged. The types are this package's own, not
// raft.FileEntry: internal/backup must not import internal/cluster, and
// cmd/arc/main.go adapts the coordinator to these interfaces.
