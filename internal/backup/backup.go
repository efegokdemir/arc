// Source-read failures are skippable: the file may legitimately have been
// deleted by compaction or retention between listing and copy. The other
// explicitly skippable case is an overlong destination key, checked before
// streaming in copyDataFiles.
//
// Every other failure — temp file creation, seek, backup-storage write — is
// fatal. Those indicate a broken environment (no temp space, unwritable or
// unreachable backup storage), not a race, and continuing would produce a
// backup that silently omits files while reporting success.

// backup destination would overrun the storage key limit (#761). The first

// but, in any deployment Arc itself wrote, affects no file at all. A low
// ceiling absorbs both. Anything above it is a different event — throttling,

// too long to back up — where returning a fraction of the data as a

// Every leg in the set commits a manifest AND a sidecar, even with zero files
// (decision 4 of the B2b-2 plan), and that is what makes "RunTargets
// membership means exactly has-a-manifest" true. Three things fall out of it:
// a routed database whose name is a typo produces a leg with total_files: 0,
// which is the operator-facing signal and is not confusable with a target the
// run failed to commit to; a cluster restore refuses outright when a backup
// has no sidecar, so an empty leg that skipped its sidecar would make an
// otherwise-good run unrestorable on a cluster; and aborted-run detection
// stays a clean predicate.
//
// The set is defined BY THE SCOPE, because "always commits" is only safe once
// it is:
//
//   - an UNSCOPED run touches the default target plus every target that is
//     ROUTED at least one database. Not every CONFIGURED target: a target with
//     no databases= of its own is inert, and making it a leg would make it a
//     hard dependency of every backup in the instance — an operator who adds
//     the [backup.targets.x] block in one commit and its routing in the next,
//     or whose credentials for it are wrong, would break whole-instance
//     backups that have no business touching it. Each leg is probed before
//     anything is copied, and one unreachable leg fails the run.
//   - a SCOPED run touches the default target plus each target that owns at
//     least one scoped database. Not every routed target: a run scoped to
//     ["prod"] must not write an empty Scope=[prod], Databases=[] manifest
//     onto audit_bucket, where it would list as a prod backup holding nothing.
//
// The typo signal survives the stricter rule in both cases. A misspelled name
// in databases= still means that target IS routed something, so it is still a
// leg and still commits a manifest with total_files 0 — which is the signal an
// operator reads. What drops out is only the target nothing is routed to at
// all, whose empty manifest would say nothing a reader could act on.

// the KEY and not of the backend: every key it is given is "<backupID>/..."
// for a backup ID minted by this run, so nothing but this run can have put an
// object there on any target, and removing it is never destructive.
//
// WHAT THAT INVARIANT ACTUALLY RESTS ON, corrected (#1085 stage B2b-1). An
// earlier draft of this comment claimed the premise moved from the code to the
// configuration once a destination could be remote. It did not. Every one of
// the four call sites — the data copy, the SQLite copy, the sidecar and the
// warehouse copy — passes a key of the form "<backupID>/…" for an ID this run
// minted, and no other writer in Arc produces that shape, so the key
// NAMESPACE is what makes the Delete safe — and that is a property of the
// code, unchanged by where the destination points or how many there are.
//
// Two honest qualifications rather than an absolute. The shape is not
// reserved: a hyphen is legal in a key segment, so a database named with the
// exact 31-character backup-ID spelling could in principle collide, which
// makes the namespace claim true in practice rather than by construction. And
// it only matters at all if two stores overlap, which is the thing
// config.checkBackupDestinationOverlap refuses.
//
// So the overlap refusal is still right, and it protects DIFFERENT things than
// this function: a backup destination inside the storage root is re-copied by
// every subsequent backup (the data listing returns every .parquet under the
// root), which on a cluster inflates the unregistered-skip count until the
// skip ratio refuses every replace-mode restore; and with reconciliation
// enabled and dry-run off, the sweep DELETES the backups, because a backup
// data key has nine segments and its managed-path heuristic triggers at seven.
// Those are the hazards. This Delete is cheap insurance on top.
//
// What does follow for THIS function: with a remote target the Delete below is
// the branch that always runs, where before it was unreachable because only
// LocalBackend implements storage.StagingInspector (s3.go and azure.go say in
// comments that they do not).
//
// What each backend actually leaves behind, established against the vendored
// SDKs rather than assumed:
//
//   - LocalBackend stages: "<key>.part" exists and the key does not. Removed
//     through DeleteStaged, exactly as before.
//   - S3 commits nothing on a failed write. A failed PutObject writes no
//     object, and manager.Uploader defaults LeavePartsOnError to false, so a
//     failed multipart calls AbortMultipartUpload itself
//     (feature/s3/manager@v1.20.12 upload.go:312, :855).
//   - Azure commits nothing either. azblob's UploadStream stages blocks and
//     then issues ONE CommitBlockList, or for a payload inside a single block
//     one Upload (blockblob@v1.6.4 chunkwriting.go:146, :171). Uncommitted
//     blocks are not readable and the service garbage-collects them.
//
// So the Delete below covers exactly one case: the commit SUCCEEDED and the
// success never came back — a lost response, or a retry that reported the
// error after the object had landed. That is the only way a committed object
// sits at the key after WriteReader returned an error. It is cheap insurance
// against that, and it is honest about what it does not reach: a Delete cannot
// abort an abandoned S3 multipart upload (the SDK's own abort runs on the
// failing context, so a CANCELLED one leaves parts behind — buckets taking
// Arc backups want an AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload lifecycle rule), and it
// cannot touch uncommitted Azure blocks.
//
// Best-effort, like the staging branch: logged at Debug and never fatal. The
// write already failed and that error is the one the caller must surface.

// not arbitrarily. A skipped data file is counted in the manifest, named in
// the skip sample, carried into the INCOMPLETE marker, and still held by the
// source, so a restore can see what it is missing. A skipped recovery
// manifest is invisible to a restore: it brings back the compacted output AND
// the inputs it replaced, nothing reconciles them, and the partition serves
// every row twice. So data skips; compaction state and the Iceberg warehouse
// fail.
//
// A third option was available, and understanding why it loses is the point:
// skip, count, and set the incomplete marker. It is not that nothing RECORDS
// the skip — progress.SkippedFiles and the manifest would both carry it. It is
// that the restore path does not READ that counter. It reads
// UnregisteredSkipped, ManifestOnlyFiles, LeftManifestDuringRun, and
// SkippedFiles against TotalFiles; a compaction-state skip is deliberately
// outside the TotalFiles population (see skipTally), so the one number that
// would carry the warning is the one a restore never consults. Teaching it to
// is a larger change than this, and would still leave the window between a
// backup that reported success and the restore that acts on it.
//
// What the check buys is the message, not the outcome. Before it, the overrun
// surfaced from inside WriteReader as a generic backup-storage write failure,
// which is not a source-read error and so failed the run anyway but said
// nothing about the key. Unlike the unreadable-but-exists branch below, this
// failure is deterministic: a retry changes nothing, so the error asks for a
// rename instead. Arc writes its own state keys short and fixed-shape, so
// reaching this needs a foreign file dropped under _compaction_state/.
