// Destination is one storage location reduced to the few things that decide
// whether two locations are the same place.
//
// It exists for ONE caller shape: refusing a configuration in which two
// subsystems that both write would write over each other. The backup
// destination (#1085 stage B) is the case that forced it, because a backup
// destination that contains the primary storage root is backed up by the next
// backup and swept by reconciliation, and a backup destination that shares a
// bucket prefix with the cold tier makes the backup listing see cold-tier
// objects.
//
// Comparison is deliberately COARSE and errs toward "these overlap". Two
// locations that are not provably distinct are reported as overlapping,
// because the caller turns the answer into a startup refusal: a false refusal
// is a config file an operator edits once, and a false clearance is silent
// data loss.
//
// Built as a function over two Destinations rather than over one pair of
// config blocks because the backup-target check compares N targets against
// each other as well as against these two (#1085 stage B2b-2), and N-squared
// calls of a two-argument function is the shape that extends without
// rewriting.
type Destination struct {
	// Kind is "local", "s3" or "azure". The spelling aliases (minio for s3,
	// azblob for azure) are normalised away, so two differently-spelled
	// configurations of one store compare equal.
	Kind string

	// Store identifies the object store instance, CANONICALISED so that two
	// spellings of one store compare equal. Empty on a local destination.
	//
	// Canonicalising is load bearing, not tidiness. An operator may leave
	// s3_endpoint empty for AWS on one side and spell it
	// "s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com" on the other, or name an Azure account on
	// one side and give its "<account>.blob.core.windows.net" endpoint on the
	// other. Those are the same store, and comparing the raw strings reported
	// them as different — so the refusal was MISSED for the same bucket and
	// the same prefix. See canonicalS3Endpoint and azureStore.
	//
	// For s3 it is the endpoint with any AWS spelling folded to "", so "" is
	// a real identity (AWS) rather than a missing one. For azure it is the
	// storage account where one can be resolved, and the endpoint otherwise
	// (Azurite, a custom host). StoreUnknown is how "could not be determined"
	// is said.
	Store string

	// StoreUnknown says the store identity could not be resolved from the
	// configuration, which is reachable only for an Azure config carrying
	// neither an endpoint, an account name, nor a parseable connection string.
	// Such a destination compares equal to every store of its kind, so the
	// answer errs toward refusal: a false clearance is a backup that re-copies
	// itself on every run, or one the reconciliation sweep deletes, both
	// permanent and both silent. (An earlier draft justified this by
	// cleanupPartialBackupWrite's premise instead; that framing was retracted in
	// config.checkBackupDestinationOverlap, where the real hazards are
	// recorded, because that function's keys are all "<backupID>/..." for an ID
	// the run minted and therefore carry their own premise.) Note that
	// config.Load
	// requires one of those three for an Azure block, so an unknown identity
	// is a configuration Arc would already have refused.
