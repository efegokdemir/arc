// "no data yet": most S3-compatible stores create the bucket on the first
// authenticated write, so the state heals itself and a 500 on the read is
// pure noise (#945). But a caller that DECIDES from a listing — drops a tier
// from a query, retires a metadata row, reports a backup complete — must
// never read a missing store as "verified empty", because that turns a
// misconfigured bucket name into a silently wrong answer.
//

// hide (a dot-prefixed name, a key the contract refuses, a staging partial) is
// not a hit, so "false" from the probe and "empty" from ListObjects agree. A
// prefix that names nothing at all is false with a nil error.

// query path still serves them because read_parquet globs the filesystem, and
// nothing anywhere could name them. A backup would then omit them and report
// success, which is the failure #743's own commit message called worse than the
