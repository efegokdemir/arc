// two in iceberg), and they disagreed: #258 added the S3 prefix to some copies
// and missed others, which left retention reading a location nothing was ever
// written to.
//
// The matching INVERSE (URL back to a backend-relative key) deliberately does
// not live here. Its one consumer is partition pruning, which must invert a
// URL for a tier whose backend is not the one it holds, so it trims the root
// parsed out of that tier's own glob instead of type-switching on a backend.
// See PartitionPruner.extractStoragePrefix.

// ObjectURI returns the fully-qualified location of key for engines that read

// Those engines are the reason #743's contract was not enough on its own. A
// Backend method validates its key, but these callers never call one: they hand
// a URI to another process. This is the second chokepoint, and it enforces the
// same contract.
//
// It does NOT apply ValidateGlobSafe, and that is deliberate. Glob-safety is a
// property of the SINK, not of the location: iceberg-go opens this path as a
// literal object and os.Open takes it verbatim, so a key containing "*" is
// perfectly readable there and rejecting it would fail an export over a file
// that resolves fine. Only a caller interpolating the result into a DuckDB
// path needs the extra rule, and those callers apply it themselves.
