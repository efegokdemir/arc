// #1162 shipped this as a 10-entry sample, on the assumption that job history

// for memory splits 30 -> 15 -> 7 -> 3, so ONE failing batch emits four
// records. The customer case is 80 partitions over ~1,500 batches, so a cycle
// that fails throughout emits ~6,000 records against a 100-entry job ring --
// under 2% of the answer. (Even one batch per partition would be ~320, still
// three times the ring.)
//
// This list is the complete answer instead, because it is populated at the
// outer dispatch level (one call per failed batch, no split-attempt noise) and
// keyed by partition path, so the many batches of one partition collapse to
// one entry. The customer case that motivated #1162 is 80 partitions over
// ~1,500 batches; deduplicated that is 80 entries.
//
// 200 distinct partitions is ~16 KB per cycle at typical path lengths. Against
