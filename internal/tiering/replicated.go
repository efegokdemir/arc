// Tier metadata for files this node did not write itself.
//
// Before this, a node's tier_files only ever described files it had ingested:
// the flush path registers what it writes (internal/ingest, RecordFile) and
// ScanAndRegisterFiles picks up the rest — but that scan runs only from
// POST /api/v1/tiering/scan, from the pre-migration scan inside a migration
// cycle, and (since this change) once at startup. At the default
// migration_schedule of 02:00 that is once a day.
//
// On a cluster node with per-node storage and file replication, most of what
// is on disk arrives from a peer, and most of what leaves does so because
// another node migrated it. Between daily scans the metadata and the disk
// disagree, and the query layer routes reads from the metadata:
//
//   - a measurement with no row at all falls back to an unpruned
//     {db}/{meas}/**/*.parquet glob (a performance cost), and
//   - a measurement with a cold row and no hot row loses its local hot glob
//     entirely, so files sitting on this node's disk are silently left out of
//     the answer (a correctness cost).
//
// This file closes both directions: the replication puller reports what it
// pulled, the local-delete worker reports what it unlinked, and a single
// drainer applies both to tier_files.
//
// Why a drainer rather than a write per event: tiering shares one *sql.DB with
// auth, audit, CQ and retention, and that handle is opened with
// SetMaxOpenConns(1). A write per pulled file, from the puller's workers and
// the delete workers at once, would queue on that single connection against
// live authentication, the audit writer and the ingest flush path's own
// registration. AuthManager.lastUsedLoop solved the same problem the same way;
// its comment is worth reading. A batching drainer also bounds how often the
// tier cache is invalidated: see the note above recordHotFileIfNotCold.

//     that it can never act on it (#758), so neither the sync nor a restore
//     may act on it either.
//   - failed — the path could not be parsed, so no row was even attempted.

// A non-nil error means NOTHING in the batch was written (the store runs one
// transaction per call and rolls it back), so the caller counts the whole
// submitted chunk as unrecorded rather than having to ask how far it got.

// stats the HOT backend and returns false for a file that is not there, and
// whose upsert is guarded tier = 'hot' — so a cold restore reported through it
// is silently dropped twice over (#1139 is that guard seen from the other
// side). Written synchronously rather than through the event queue because a
// restore is already a bounded, operator-initiated batch and the caller counts
// the outcome per file.
//
// migratedAt is NOW, not the object's timestamp, and that is deliberate: a
// hot-to-cold flip stamped in the past sits outside the orphan reconciliation
// window, so a stale hot copy at the same key would never be cleaned up and
// would keep peers replicating it. The cost is that a large cold restore puts
// its rows inside that window and each costs one hot-side existence check per
// cycle until they age out. See RecordColdFile.
//
// One cost this still deliberately accepts: the cleanup it relies on is ROLE
// GATED. ReconcileOrphanedFiles removes the stale hot copy, but it runs past
// m.roleGated(), and RestoreBackup is not writer gated — so a restore
// performed on a FOLLOWER writes rows whose cleanup never runs on that node,
// and the rows live in that node's own SQLite, so no other node does it
// either. Restore on the primary writer when the backup holds cold files.
//
// (The other cost #1086 accepted — one synchronous write, and so one fsync,
// per file on the single shared connection — is what #1141 removed by making
// this a batch.)

// applyUnlinked decides what the removal of this node's local copy means for

// The reason is a hint only, and must be: the operator manifest-delete
// endpoint passes whatever ?reason= it is given, so a reason that looks like a
// migration is not proof of one. Treating it as proof would insert a cold row
// for a path with no cold object — and nothing retires such a row, because
// orphan reconciliation only examines cold rows whose hot copy still exists
// and the cold sync reports a missing object rather than reverting the row.
// The measurement would then lose its hot glob: the very bug this file fixes.
//
// So a migration-shaped reason buys one existence check against the cold
// backend, and the check decides:
//
//   - the object is there — the file really did move to cold, and this node
//     can read it there. Flip (or insert) the cold row.
//   - it is not — the file is simply gone from this node. Retire the hot row.
//
// Every other reason retires the hot row with no check. Those are the
// high-volume ones, and the file is genuinely gone in each case: a compaction
// that consumed it (compaction:<jobID>), a retention or operator delete
// ("retention:<policyID>", "delete", "operator", anything an admin types) and
// the reconciler's orphan-manifest sweep ("reconcile-orphan-manifest"). The
// "delete" path rewrites files and can re-register a path, which is safe here
// because the delete worker re-checks the manifest before unlinking at all and
// skips a path that is back.
//
// There are three outcomes, not two: the cold check can also FAIL, and it
// then retires the hot row like the absent case — see the comment at that
// branch for why. Note the event is counted as applied in that case, because
// a row was written; the Warn is the signal that the cold tier was
// unreachable.
