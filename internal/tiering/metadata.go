// absent from a backup listing and from the manifest inventory while still
// holding the rows this counts. Returning the group means the caller never has
// to discover the set first, and it cannot half-fail the way N point queries
// can.
//
// Quarantined rows are excluded, as in GetFilesOlderThan: a quarantined file
// is one tiering has established it can never act on (#758), so it is not a
// file a backup is missing. Defensive today — quarantineCandidate leaves the
// row in the HOT tier (migrator.go) — and correct if that ever changes.

// Measured, not assumed, on this schema at 200k rows with a third of them
// cold, before and after ANALYZE (which changes nothing, and which nothing in
// Arc runs anyway):

// idx_tier_files_database_tier is not picked, in either state: tier is that
// index's SECOND column, so tier = ? cannot seek it. Forcing it with INDEXED BY
// gives a full SCAN of the index — no temp b-tree, since the index is already
// in database order, but every row visited including hot and a table lookup for
// quarantined_at on each match, which no index covers. It loses by ~1.5x.
//
// This is NOT the fastest plan available, and the comment says so rather than
// claiming optimality, because the next person to read it will otherwise
// conclude nothing better exists. A covering index on
// (tier, database, quarantined_at) seeks on the leading column, needs no temp
// b-tree and no table lookups, is picked WITHOUT ANALYZE, and is ~6x faster
// (~21 ms down to ~3 ms). It is deliberately not added: it costs ~7% of the
// database file and a sixth b-tree to maintain on tier_files, which the ingest
// flush path writes to on every file registration, and it buys ~18 ms ONCE per
// backup run — on an operation that copies gigabytes over minutes. Wrong trade
// today.
//
// The scale at which to revisit it: the read is linear in matched rows, about
// 330 ns each, and it holds the shared SQLite connection for its duration
// (the pool is SetMaxOpenConns(1)), so it stalls auth, audit and tier
// registration for as long as it runs. At 1M cold rows that is ~330 ms once
// per backup, which is where the covering index stops being a bad trade.
