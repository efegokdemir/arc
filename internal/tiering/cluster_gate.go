// ClusterGate is the minimal role check the tiering manager needs to decide
// whether the local node may run a migration cycle. Only the primary writer
// migrates and deletes; every other node still keeps its tier metadata in
// sync (see Manager.ScanTiers) because the query layer routes from that
// metadata. It lives here rather than in the cluster package so tiering
// has no compile-time dependency on it — the same shape as
// compaction.ClusterGate and scheduler.WriterGate. A nil gate means "no
// check, allow": OSS, standalone and per-node-storage clusters, where each
// node's metadata is authoritative for its own storage.
type ClusterGate interface {
	// IsPrimaryWriter reports whether the local node may mutate storage.
	IsPrimaryWriter() bool
	// Role returns the node's role for log messages and API responses only;
	// IsPrimaryWriter is authoritative.

}

// ErrMigrationRoleGated is returned by RunMigrationCycle and TriggerMigration
// when a gate is wired and the node is not the primary writer. The scheduler
// treats it as a quiet skip; the API maps it to 409 Conflict.

// is still running on this node. Two overlapping cycles would let the
// second one's metadata sync observe the first one's half-finished copy.

// ErrScanRunning reports that a tier scan is already in progress on this node,
// so this caller did not start a second one. See Manager.scanRunning for why
// the exported scan is serialized and the in-cycle scan is not (#1154).
