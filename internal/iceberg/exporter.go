// Package iceberg publishes Arc's existing Parquet files as Apache Iceberg tables so
// external engines (Spark, Trino, Snowflake, DuckDB) can read Arc's data directly, without
// changing Arc's ingest write path. It is a periodic *reconciler*: it diffs Arc's durable
// file set (the storage backend walk) against the current Iceberg table state and commits the
// delta via iceberg-go's ReplaceDataFiles and AddFiles (register/deregister existing Parquet
// by path — no data rewrite). Because it is driven by Arc's durable storage — not a transient event stream —
// a failed or missed commit self-heals on the next reconcile tick.
//
// Verified in Phase 0/0b: iceberg-go v0.6.0 + the mattn sqlite3 catalog registers Arc's
// field-ID-less Parquet (AddFiles auto-emits schema.name-mapping.default) and a non-DuckDB
// engine (PyIceberg) reads it back correctly. Arc's `time` column is TIMESTAMP_MICROS with
// isAdjustedToUTC=1, which MUST map to Iceberg timestamptz (not timestamp) or AddFiles fails.

//   - Partition inference. iceberg-go infers each file's day() partition value from its
//     Parquet time min/max and ERRORS ("more than one value for partition field") when one
//     file's data straddles a UTC-day boundary (rare: backfill or a flush crossing midnight).
//     Left unhandled, one such file wedges the whole measurement's export on every pass. The
//     fallback adds files one at a time and skips (and returns) the ones that can't be mapped.
//
//   - Stale DELETED history ("cannot add files that are already referenced by table").
//     A removed file's DELETED manifest entry is checked against new adds, so a path that left
//     the table and comes back is refused: an in-place rewrite (#633), a backup restore of a key
//     that had been removed, or history from before this release. On iceberg-go v0.6.0 the
//     tombstone was carried into EVERY later snapshot, so such a path could never come back at
//     all; since v0.7.0 the overwrite producer drops a manifest with no surviving entries, so a
//     tombstone is shed on the next overwrite and the refusal is rare rather than permanent. The
//     refusal wording is unchanged, so this branch still fires when it applies. For those adds the transaction
//     enables Iceberg manifest merging (commit.manifest-merge.enabled) and retries with the
//     duplicate check off: the merge-append rewrites the manifests keeping DELETED entries
//     only of its own snapshot, so the stale entries are gone once the commit lands and a later
//     removal of the path sees exactly one entry again. Such a pass lands as two snapshots in
//     the one commit (the removes as an overwrite, then the merged append), so readers of the
//     current snapshot never see the path absent; only time travel to the intermediate
//     snapshot does, until it expires. The property is switched back off in the same
//     transaction — see manifestMergeOn for why it must not stay on.
//
// When collapse is set the transaction also gets a merge-enabled append that rewrites the whole
// manifest set into one (#1106), staged after the diff and before Commit, whichever of the paths
// above staged it. The caller decides — see shouldCollapse for the conditions. It is cleared if

// manifestCollapseThreshold is the number of data manifests in the current snapshot at which a

// reproducible from internal/iceberg/deleted_manifest_cost_test.go on iceberg-go v0.7.0; measured
// local backend, Apple silicon, so read the ratios rather than the absolute milliseconds.
//
// What the pile costs, per accumulated manifest: ~0.24 ms per reconcile pass and ~0.105 ms per
// reader PlanFiles.
//
// What a collapse costs, as the marginal cost over the ordinary pass it replaces, measured where
// there is nothing to collapse yet (4 manifests) so the pile's own scan cost cannot flatter it:
// 5 ms at 300 live files, 8 ms at 1000, 33 ms at 5000, 66 ms at 10 000 — roughly 2 ms + 6.4 ms per
// 1000 live files, linear in table size because it rewrites the whole live set into one manifest.
//
// A removal pass adds ONE manifest (the rewritten manifest holding the removed entry, plus this
// pass's additions, minus the one the overwrite producer now drops when nothing survives in it), so
// between collapses the count averages ~T/2 and the amortised per-pass cost is 0.12*T + C(N)/T,
// minimised at T = sqrt(C(N)/0.12): 6.5 at 300 live files, 8.2 at 1000, 16.6 at 5000, 23.5 at
// 10 000. Twelve is within ~1.25x of optimal across that whole range.
//
// Reader plan time is paid per query rather than per pass, which would favour a lower threshold, but
// at 4 manifests it is already indistinguishable from one (1.53 vs 1.34 ms at 300 files, 18.4 vs
// 17.9 ms at 5000), so there is nothing to buy below ~10.
//
// On iceberg-go v0.6.0 a removal pass added TWO manifests and each cost ~1.6 ms per pass, which put
// the optimum at 4.5-12.3 and made this constant worth about six passes of headroom instead of
// twelve. v0.7.0 drops the DELETED-only manifest the overwrite producer used to carry forward
// (apache/iceberg-go#1153, #1393) and parallelises the manifest scan. The collapse is still needed:
// the remaining one-per-pass growth is still unbounded, and v0.7.0 does not reduce the .avro count
// on disk at all (258 files after 64 passes on both versions) — that is the orphan sweep's job.
//
// It is deliberately not a config key: the only consequence of a wrong value is a slower or a more
// frequent collapse, never data loss, so there is no operator decision to expose. Contrast
// iceberg.orphan_sweep_enabled, which gates irreversible deletion.
const manifestCollapseThreshold = 12

// shouldCollapse reports whether this pass should also collapse the table's manifest set.
// liveAfter is the number of data files the pass is driving the table to — len(want) at the call
// site, not the count it has now.
//
// It reads the manifest list of the CURRENT snapshot: one local file open (Iceberg export requires
// storage.backend="local"), uncached and side-effect free. It must be called before the pass
// stages anything, because after a successful ReplaceDataFiles the transaction can no longer be
// re-driven.
//
// Two conditions beyond the threshold, both load-bearing:
//
//   - liveAfter > 0. A pass that empties the measurement (the scheduler's all-data-files-gone
//     branch reconciles the table to EMPTY rather than leave it pointing at deleted paths) stages
//     an overwrite in which EVERY entry is DELETED and attributed to the overwrite's snapshot, not
//     the collapse's. manifestMergeManager.createManifest keeps a DELETED entry only when it
//     belongs to the snapshot being written, so the merge would drop all of them and write an
//     empty manifest, which ManifestWriter.Close refuses (ErrEmptyManifest). On iceberg-go v0.6.0
//     that error failed the pass, and the scheduler caches no fingerprint for a failed pass, so
//     the SAME pass failed on every tick from then on: the table pointed at deleted files forever,
//     the exact harm that branch exists to prevent.
//
//     On v0.7.0 that error is no longer REACHABLE from here, and the reason is worth stating so
//     nobody removes the guard on the strength of a passing test. Reaching it needs at least two
//     inherited data manifests whose entries are all foreign-DELETED; v0.7.0 drops a manifest with
//     no surviving entries instead of carrying it forward, so an emptying pass inherits exactly
//     one (this pass's own tombstone) and mergeBin takes its single-manifest passthrough without
//     ever calling createManifest. The guard is kept as belt-and-braces: it costs one comparison,
//     it encodes the intent (do not run a merge with nothing to merge), and reachability returns
//     with a multi-spec table or any upstream change to that drop. Its tests no longer
//     discriminate on v0.7.0 and say so on themselves.
//
//   - Only DATA manifests are counted. The merge producer merges data manifests and passes delete
//     manifests through untouched, so counting those would compare a number the collapse cannot
//     reduce against the threshold — and a table carrying threshold-many unmergeable manifests
//     would then collapse on EVERY pass, which is the O(files)-of-metadata-per-pass cost that
//     manifestMergeOn's comment exists to rule out. Arc writes no delete files; another engine
//     writing merge-on-read deletes into the table would.

// Reachability is computed from the metadata files ON DISK, never from the current snapshot alone.
// Arc deliberately keeps older entry points a reader can resolve: retain+1 v<N>.metadata.json
// copies (see pruneOldVersionFiles) and iceberg-go's own NNNNN-*.metadata.json log. A reader that
// resolves any of them gets that file's snapshots, so every .avro any on-disk metadata.json can
