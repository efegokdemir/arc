// which is the rewrite-instead-of-reject shape #741 removed from LocalBackend.

// re-joining the base path, so the URI names the file the backend reads and
// writes by construction.
//
// The only caller is StorageWalkSource.FilesAndLocal, whose input is
// Backend.List output, so a rejection means the listing produced a key the same

// drop a data file from the exported Iceberg table, which is silent data loss
