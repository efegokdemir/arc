// Three modes, in priority order:
//
//  1. Pattern 2 shared-storage multi-writer mode
//     (cfg.Cluster.SharedStorageMode=true): N RoleWriter nodes accept writes
//     concurrently and PUT to the same object-storage backend. There is no
//     "primary writer" concept — every writer is equivalent for ingest.
//     Singleton tasks must still run on exactly one node to avoid duplicate
//     work, so we gate on the cluster Raft leader AND RoleWriter. The role
//     check matters because every joining node becomes a Raft voter
//     regardless of role; without it, a RoleReader or RoleCompactor that
//     wins the election would run retention/CQ/delete.
//
//     Leader-change semantics: each scheduler (retention, CQ, delete, tiering migration,
//     delete endpoints) checks IsPrimaryWriter() ONCE at the start of each
//     tick and runs all work for that tick if true. A leader change
//     mid-tick will let the demoted node complete its current tick's
//     work; the new leader's next tick picks up from there. This is
//     correct for retention/CQ (idempotent post-states) but is a known
//     ~tick-window of duplicate-singleton-work on leader change. Tighter
//     gating would require pushing the check into each per-item loop,
//     deferred until operators report it as a real problem.
//
//     See docs/progress/2026-05-26-multi-writer-pattern2.md.
//
//  2. Pattern 1 single-writer with no failover manager: WriterState stays at
//     its zero value (no CommandPromoteWriter is ever issued), so any
//     RoleWriter node is authoritative for singleton tasks. Same as today.
//
//  3. Pattern 1 single-writer with failover manager: the failover manager
//     issues CommandPromoteWriter to elect one writer as primary; only that
//     node returns true. Same as today.
//
// MayAcceptIngest reports whether writes should be sent to this node. It is
// what a load balancer's write pool needs, and it is NOT IsPrimaryWriter:
// in shared-storage mode every healthy writer accepts writes, while
// IsPrimaryWriter names the single node that runs singleton work, so pointing
// a write pool at that would collapse an N-writer cluster onto one node.
//
//   - a role that cannot ingest never accepts writes
//   - shared storage: every writer accepts, the pattern's whole premise
