	// manifest, so the echo is what will run.
	//
	// A manifest that cannot be READ is an ERROR here, not a fall-through to
	// "as for an unscoped backup" (#1085 stage B2b-1). The manager was always
	// the authority and still is — it fails hard on a manifest read error,
	// re-resolves the mode from the manifest it read and re-runs
	// CheckScopedReplace — so the restore never actually ran with the wrong
	// mode. What the fall-through produced was a 202 that LIED: an operator
	// told "mode: merge" while the manager would run "replace", or the
	// reverse. With a local destination the read could hardly fail; with a
	// remote one it is an ordinary transient, and an operator who reads
	// "merge" and stops worrying is the hazard. 503 rather than 500 for the
	// same reason rejectUnlessPrimaryWriter uses it: the honest advice is to
	// retry.
	//
	// A manifest that is ABSENT is a different answer and keeps the behaviour
	// it has: admitted, and failed asynchronously by the manager with "backup
	// not found". The echoed mode is not a lie in that case because no
	// restore runs at all, the progress record carries the failure, and the
	// asynchronous not-found failure is a tested contract this change has no
	// reason to break. Only "the manifest may exist and I could not reach it"
	// gets the 503.
